# retry - combinators for monadic actions that may fail

## About

Monadic action combinators that add delayed-retry functionality,
potentially with exponential-backoff, to arbitrary actions.

The main purpose of this package is to make it easy to work reliably
with IO and similar actions that often fail. Common examples are
database queries and large file uploads.
